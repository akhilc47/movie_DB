1. A movie class(under /cpp) was defined with attributes such as Title, Year etc., this was the starting point.

2. Used python scripts(under /python) to clean up names of movies and then collecting info from omdb API. Using this movieDB.txt was filled
   as a database for movie information. Posters were also collected and stored, which are not uploaded to git.
   
3. Implemented a GUI in Qt for browsing movies which displays info and can be filtered based on year(before/after), IMDB rating or Rotten 
   Tomatoes rating.
